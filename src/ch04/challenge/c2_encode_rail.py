     Calculate the letter 'cycle' (C) by dividing the total number of letters

     every 4n letter, the middle rail is every (4n Â± 1) letter, and the bottom
     rail is every 4(n + 2) letter. After splitting, concatenate each rail and
     return the result.

    Returns:
        String with message encrypted using 3 rail fence cipher.
