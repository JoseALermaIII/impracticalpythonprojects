BUILDING TRAINING TEXT
**********************

Background
----------

Rather than find haiku in the public domain, I used other text in the public
domain. Specifically, William Shakespeare's Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.


Methodology
-----------

Accessing text from Project Gutenberg is for human readers only! As a result, I
manually accessed the page, copied the text into a word processor, then used
regular expressions to remove text that wasn't spoken.

For example, to remove actions like [Sang.]:
\[.+\]

The leading space left by lines that began with an action:
^\s

Or the speakers of the lines, like JULIET.:
[A-Z]*\s?[A-Z]+\.\s

This creates an old English training text based entirely on the single play
Romeo and Juliet. Syllable counts for words not in CMUdict's phoneme list will
have to be manually provided.
