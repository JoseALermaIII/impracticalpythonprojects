I'm a digram counter.
If you don't know what I can be used for, then you don't need me.
Seriously, though, I can be used for cryptographic frequency analysis - which
probably makes even less sense...

Analyzing: volvo

In the Ubuntu default `american-english` dictionary, these are
the digram counts for the above word:
Counter({'lo': 3554,
         'ol': 3376,
         'oo': 2265,
         'ov': 1223,
         'vo': 603,
         'lv': 260,
         'vv': 21,
         'vl': 12})

The "lo" digram occurs 3554 times!
