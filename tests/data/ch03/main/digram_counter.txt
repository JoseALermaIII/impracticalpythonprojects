I'm a digram counter.
If you don't know what I can be used for, then you don't need me.
Seriously, though, I can be used for cryptographic frequency analysis - which
probably makes even less sense...

Analyzing: volvo

In the Ubuntu default `american-english` dictionary, these are
the digram counts for the above word:
Counter({'lo': 7,
         'oo': 6,
         'ol': 5,
         'ov': 4,
         'vo': 3,
         'lv': 2,
         'vl': 1,
         'vv': 0})

The "lo" digram occurs 7 times!
