Example implementations of the practice and challenge projects in
`Impractical Python Projects`_. Alternative answers to practice projects and
supporting files can be found at the `official GitHub page`_.

It's a fantastic intermediate level book that has truly impractical (but fun)
projects. It's a great way to get tricked into learning new conventions,
techniques, and modules. My `closed PRs`_ and the comments on my `release`_
commits act as a blog of sorts detailing some of the things learned along
the way.

My original `python-tutorials`_ repository is already very nested, so these
will be easier to find and review here; however, the original repository still
has relevant information about configuring a Python environment/IDE.

Bonus content includes Google style docstrings (such wow), main functions (so
standard), pip requirements files (so helpful), and test files (**not** punny
at all).
